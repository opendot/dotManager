dotManager
==========

dotManager is a **Python** software to manage the members of a FabLab and their operations inside it.  
It permits the interface with an existing **Drupal** instance, using its **XML-RPC** native module.  
dotManager is developed and currently used inside the [opendot](http://www.opendotlab.it) FabLab in Milan, Italy.

## Where ##
**opendot** is a makerspace, a place for meetings and exchange, an hotbed of experimentation, innovation and research.  
In opendot, every member own a personal **RFID card** that includes an unique identifier.  
To each card is associated, as well as basic information about the member, also an electronic wallet with the internal currency, called **dot**.
These dots could be obtained by buying a membership plan or by doing works useful for the FabLab, and could be spent by using the machines and their materials.  

## What ##
The dotManager software permits to manage all the basics operations about the members' subscriptions and their usage of the machines. In particular:

* Create a new member account
* Activate an existing member account
* Get information about an account
* Increase "dots"
* Decrease "dots"

## How ##
Configuration instructions are coming soon...
